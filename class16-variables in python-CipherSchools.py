# Variables are something that act as container that store some value in it
#Values stored in variables can be of string type or number type

var1=34
print(var1)

go2="143"
print(go2)

#Variable value can be changed 
#If we give some another value with the same variable name that was already used then that variable will print new value instead of printing previous value
zee="943"
print(zee)
zee="69" 
print(zee)
# As value of zee is changed so now new value of zee will get print that is "69 not "943"


#any word stored in variable should be in double commas
soc="CR"
print(soc)

#some rules of variables
#1. variable should not start with the number but number can be used in between name
# 1num="few" <-- it will give error
nu1m="fewer"
print(nu1m)

#2. variable name can start with underscore
_info = "variable name can start with underscore"
print(_info)

#3. variable name cannot start with special symbol and also it cannot be used in between of variable name
