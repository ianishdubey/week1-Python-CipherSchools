#user input
#input function
name=input("type your name: ")
print("Hello "+name)

#string
age=input("What is your age?\n ") #input has been taken in the form of string " "

#Proof 
print("Your age is "+ age) #string concatenates with string only so this shows "age" input has been taken in the form of string instead of taken it in the form of number
